Some Learning Data Index

I am learning algorithms by python. The README.md will be a list of learning material that I have got from websites.

Welcome to add more material if you find more better.

Enjoy it!

- From http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/qiuzy/ds_python/courseware/  "Data Structure and Algorithms in Python at PKU"

- From https://www.zhihu.com/question/19889750 " The book 'Python Algorithm' maybe a better start. Luckly I have got chinese and English digital version"

- From http://or.nsfc.gov.cn/bitstream/00001903-5/280826/1/1000013890101.pdf "A new approach for data processing in supply chain network based on FPGA"
  - The paper comes from NCF.GOV.CN. Some opinions as follows:
    -  How to ensure the correctness and effectiveness of data collecting and processing at the bottom layer of SCN is a key issue which relates to the further development of SCN. 
    
    -  Any network, including SCN, is constructed by various nodes. It is well known that there are many embedded devices that are deployed in these nodes of SCN and used for data collection and processing. The real time of data processing will directly affect the safety of SCN. In most cases, these devices were designed by DSP (digital signal processor) technology, but DSP is usually in serial mode when it executes the program codes; it will increase risk in SCN by reducing real time of data processing.
